There are a few different editors workflows: Local editing workflow: Editing the ontology in your local environment by hand, using tools such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, ROBOT templates or DOSDP patterns. Completely automated data pipeline (GitHub Actions) DROID workflow This document only covers the first editing workflow, but more will be added in the future Local editing workflow Workflow requirements: git github docker editing tool of choice, e.g. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, your favourite text editor, etc 1. Create issue Ensure that there is a ticket on your issue tracker that describes the change you are about to make. While this seems optional, this is a very important part of the social contract of building an ontology - no change to the ontology should be performed without a good ticket, describing the motivation and nature of the intended change. 2. Update main branch In your local environment (e.g. your laptop), make sure you are on the main (prev. master ) branch and ensure that you have all the upstream changes, for example: git checkout master git pull 3. Create feature branch Create a new branch. Per convention, we try to use meaningful branch names such as: - issue23removeprocess (where issue 23 is the related issue on GitHub) - issue26addcontributor - release20210101 (for releases) On your command line, this looks like this: git checkout -b issue23removeprocess 4. Perform edit Using your editor of choice, perform the intended edit. For example: Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Open src/ontology/pato-edit.owl in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Make the change Save the file TextEdit Open src/ontology/pato-edit.owl in TextEdit (or Sublime, Atom, Vim, Nano) Make the change Save the file Consider the following when making the edit. According to our development philosophy, the only places that should be manually edited are: src/ontology/pato-edit.owl Any ROBOT templates you chose to use (the TSV files only) Any DOSDP data tables you chose to use (the TSV files, and potentially the associated patterns) components (anything in src/ontology/components ), see here . Imports should not be edited (any edits will be flushed out with the next update). However, refreshing imports is a potentially breaking change - and is discussed elsewhere . Changes should usually be small. Adding or changing 1 term is great. Adding or changing 10 related terms is ok. Adding or changing 100 or more terms at once should be considered very carefully. 4. Check the Git diff This step is very important. Rather than simply trusting your change had the intended effect, we should always use a git diff as a first pass for sanity checking. In our experience, having a visual git client like GitHub Desktop or sourcetree is really helpful for this part. In case you prefer the command line: git status git diff 5. Quality control Now it's time to run your quality control checks. This can either happen locally ( 5a ) or through your continuous integration system ( 7/5b ). 5a. Local testing If you chose to run your test locally: sh run.sh make IMP=false test This will run the whole set of configured ODK tests on including your change. If you have a complex DOSDP pattern pipeline you may want to add PAT=false to skip the potentially lengthy process of rebuilding the patterns. sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false test 6. Pull request When you are happy with the changes, you commit your changes to your feature branch, push them upstream (to GitHub) and create a pull request. For example: git add NAMEOFCHANGEDFILES git commit -m \"Added biological process term #12\" git push -u origin issue23removeprocess Then you go to your project on GitHub, and create a new pull request from the branch, for example: https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pulls There is a lot of great advise on how to write pull requests, but at the very least you should: - mention the tickets affected: see #23 to link to a related ticket, or fixes #23 if, by merging this pull request, the ticket is fixed. Tickets in the latter case will be closed automatically by GitHub when the pull request is merged. - summarise the changes in a few sentences. Consider the reviewer: what would they want to know right away. - If the diff is large, provide instructions on how to review the pull request best (sometimes, there are many changed files, but only one important change). 7/5b. Continuous Integration Testing If you didn't run and local quality control checks (see 5a ), you should have Continuous Integration (CI) set up, for example: - Travis - GitHub Actions More on how to set this up here . Once the pull request is created, the CI will automatically trigger. If all is fine, it will show up green, otherwise red. 8. Community review Once all the automatic tests have passed, it is important to put a second set of eyes on the pull request. Ontologies are inherently social - as in that they represent some kind of community consensus on how a domain is organised conceptually. This seems high brow talk, but it is very important that as an ontology editor, you have your work validated by the community you are trying to serve (e.g. your colleagues, other contributors etc.). In our experience, it is hard to get more than one review on a pull request - two is great. You can set up GitHub branch protection to actually require a review before a pull request can be merged! We recommend this. This step seems daunting to some hopefully under-resourced ontologies, but we recommend to put this high up on your list of priorities - train a colleague, reach out! 9. Merge and cleanup When the QC is green and the reviews are in (approvals), it is time to merge the pull request. After the pull request is merged, remember to delete the branch as well (this option will show up as a big button right after you have merged the pull request). If you have not done so, close all the associated tickets fixed by the pull request. 10. Changelog (Optional) It is sometimes difficult to keep track of changes made to an ontology. Some ontology teams opt to document changes in a changelog (simply a text file in your repository) so that when release day comes, you know everything you have changed. This is advisable at least for major changes (such as a new release system, a new pattern or template etc.).","title":"Editors Workflow"},{"location":"odk-workflows/EditorsWorkflow/#editors-workflow","text":"The editors workflow is one of the formal workflows to ensure that the ontology is developed correctly according to ontology engineering principles.

Run a release with the ODK Preparation: Ensure that all your pull requests are merged into your main (master) branch Make sure that all changes to master are committed to GitHub ( git status should say that there are no modified files) Locally make sure you have the latest changes from master ( git pull ) Checkout a new branch (e.g. git checkout -b release-2021-01-01 ) You may or may not want to refresh your imports as part of your release strategy (see here ) Make sure you have the latest ODK installed by running docker pull obolibrary/odkfull To actually run the release, you: Open a command line terminal window and navigate to the src/ontology directory ( cd pato/src/ontology ) Run release pipeline: sh run.sh make prepare_release -B . Note that for some ontologies, this process can take up to 90 minutes - especially if there are large ontologies you depend on, like PRO or CHEBI. If everything went well, you should see the following output on your machine: Release files are now in ../.. - now you should commit, push and make a release on your git hosting site such as GitHub or GitLab . This will create all the specified release targets (OBO, OWL, JSON, and the variants, ont-full and ont-base) and copy them into your release directory (the top level of your repo). Review the release (Optional) Rough check. This step is frequently skipped, but for the more paranoid among us (like the author of this doc), this is a 3 minute additional effort for some peace of mind. Open the main release (pato.owl) in you favourite development environment (i.e. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9) and eyeball the hierarchy. We recommend two simple checks: Does the very top level of the hierarchy look ok? This means that all new terms have been imported/updated correctly. Does at least one change that you know should be in this release appear? For example, a new class. This means that the release was actually based on the recent edit file. Commit your changes to the branch and make a pull request In your GitHub pull request, review the following three files in detail (based on our experience): pato.obo - this reflects a useful subset of the whole ontology (everything that can be covered by OBO format). OBO format has that speaking for it: it is very easy to review! pato-base.owl - this reflects the asserted axioms in your ontology that you have actually edited. Ideally also take a look at pato-full.owl , which may reveal interesting new inferences you did not know about. Note that the diff of this file is sometimes quite large. Like with every pull request, we recommend to always employ a second set of eyes when reviewing a PR! Merge the main branch Once your CI checks have passed, and your reviews are completed, you can now merge the branch into your main branch (don't forget to delete the branch afterwards - a big button will appear after the merge is finished). Create a GitHub release Go to your releases page on GitHub by navigating to your repository, and then clicking on releases (usually on the right, for example: https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/releases). Then click \"Draft new release\" As the tag version you need to choose the date on which your ontologies were build. You can find this, for example, by looking at the pato.obo file and check the data-version: property. The date needs to be prefixed with a v , so, for example v2020-02-06 . You can write whatever you want in the release title, but we typically write the date again. The description underneath should contain a concise list of changes or term additions. Click \"Publish release\". Done. Debugging typical ontology release problems Problems with memory When you are dealing with large ontologies, you need a lot of memory. When you see error messages relating to large ontologies such as CHEBI, PRO, NCBITAXON, or Uberon, you should think of memory first, see here . Problems when using OBO format based tools Sometimes you will get cryptic error messages when using legacy tools using OBO format, such as the ontology release tool (OORT), which is also available as part of the ODK docker container. In these cases, you need to track down what axiom or annotation actually caused the breakdown. In our experience (in about 60% of the cases) the problem lies with duplicate annotations ( def , comment ) which are illegal in OBO. Here is an example recipe of how to deal with such a problem: If you get a message like make: *** [cl.Makefile:84: oort] Error 255 you might have a OORT error. To debug this, in your terminal enter sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false oort -B (assuming you are already in the ontology folder in your directory) This should show you where the error is in the log (eg multiple different definitions) WARNING: THE FIX BELOW IS NOT IDEAL, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO FIX UPSTREAM IF POSSIBLE Open pato-edit.owl in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and find the offending term and delete all offending issue (e.g. delete ALL definition, if the problem was \"multiple def tags not allowed\") and save. *While this is not idea, as it will remove all definitions from that term, it will be added back again when the term is fixed in the ontology it was imported from and added back in.

To debug this, in your terminal enter sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false oort -B (assuming you are already in the ontology folder in your directory) This should show you where the error is in the log (eg multiple different definitions) WARNING: THE FIX BELOW IS NOT IDEAL, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO FIX UPSTREAM IF POSSIBLE Open pato-edit.owl in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and find the offending term and delete all offending issue (e.g. delete ALL definition, if the problem was \"multiple def tags not allowed\") and save. *While this is not idea, as it will remove all definitions from that term, it will be added back again when the term is fixed in the ontology it was imported from and added back in. Rerun sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false oort -B and if it all passes, commit your changes to a branch and make a pull request as usual.","title":"Problems when using OBO format based tools"},{"location":"odk-workflows/RepoManagement/","text":"Managing your ODK repository Updating your ODK repository Your ODK repositories configuration is managed in src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml . The ODK Project Configuration Schema defines all possible parameters that can be used in this config YAML. Once you have made your changes, you can run the following to apply your changes to the repository: sh run.sh make update_repo There are a large number of options that can be set to configure your ODK, but we will only discuss a few of them here. NOTE for Windows users: You may get a cryptic failure such as Set Illegal Option - if the update script located in src/scripts/update_repo.sh was saved using Windows Line endings. These need to change to unix line endings. In Notepad++, for example, you can click on Edit->EOL Conversion->Unix LF to change this. Managing imports You can use the update repository workflow described on this page to perform the following operations to your imports: Add a new import Modify an existing import Remove an import you no longer want Customise an import We will discuss all these workflows in the following. Add new import To add a new import, you first edit your odk config as described above , adding an id to the product list in the import_group section (for the sake of this example, we assume you already import RO, and your goal is to also import GO): import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go Note: our ODK file should only have one import_group which can contain multiple imports (in the products section). Next, you run the update repo workflow to apply these changes. Note that by default, this module is going to be a SLME Bottom module, see here . To change that or customise your module, see section \"Customise an import\". To finalise the addition of your import, perform the following steps: Add an import statement to your src/ontology/pato-edit.owl file. We suggest to do this using a text editor, by simply copying an existing import declaration and renaming it to the new ontology import, for example as follows: ... Ontology(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato.owl> Import(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/imports/ro_import.owl>) Import(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/imports/go_import.owl>) ... Add your imports redirect to your catalog file src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml , for example: <uri name=\"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/imports/go_import.owl\" uri=\"imports/go_import.owl\"/> Test whether everything is in order: Refresh your import Open in your Ontology Editor of choice (Protege) and ensure that the expected terms are imported. Note: The catalog file src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml has one purpose: redirecting imports from URLs to local files. For example, if you have Import(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/imports/go_import.owl>) in your editors file (the ontology) and <uri name=\"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/imports/go_import.owl\" uri=\"imports/go_import.owl\"/> in your catalog, tools like robot or Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 will recognize the statement in the catalog file to redirect the URL http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/imports/go_import.owl to the local file imports/go_import.owl (which is in your src/ontology directory). Modify an existing import If you simply wish to refresh your import in light of new terms, see here . If you wish to change the type of your module see section \"Customise an import\". Remove an existing import To remove an existing import, perform the following steps: remove the import declaration from your src/ontology/pato-edit.owl . remove the id from your src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml , eg. - id: go from the list of products in the import_group . run update repo workflow delete the associated files manually: src/imports/go_import.owl src/imports/go_terms.txt Remove the respective entry from the src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml file. Customise an import By default, an import module extracted from a source ontology will be a SLME module, see here . There are various options to change the default. The following change to your repo config ( src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml ) will switch the go import from an SLME module to a simple ROBOT filter module: import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go module_type: filter A ROBOT filter module is, essentially, importing all external terms declared by your ontology (see here on how to declare external terms to be imported). Note that the filter module does not consider terms/annotations from namespaces other than the base-namespace of the ontology itself. For example, in the example of GO above, only annotations / axioms related to the GO base IRI (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_) would be considered. This behaviour can be changed by adding additional base IRIs as follows: import_group: products: - id: go module_type: filter base_iris: - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_ - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_ - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO If you wish to customise your import entirely, you can specify your own ROBOT command to do so. To do that, add the following to your repo config ( src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml ): import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go module_type: custom Now add a new goal in your custom Makefile ( src/ontology/pato.Makefile , not src/ontology/Makefile ). imports/go_import.owl: mirror/ro.owl imports/ro_terms_combined.txt if [ $(IMP) = true ]; then $(ROBOT) query -i $< --update ../sparql/preprocess-module.ru \\ extract -T imports/ro_terms_combined.txt --force true --individuals exclude --method BOT \\ query --update ../sparql/inject-subset-declaration.ru --update ../sparql/postprocess-module.ru \\ annotate --ontology-iri $(ONTBASE)/$@ $(ANNOTATE_ONTOLOGY_VERSION) --output $@.tmp.owl && mv $@.tmp.owl $@; fi Now feel free to change this goal to do whatever you wish it to do! It probably makes some sense (albeit not being a strict necessity), to leave most of the goal instead and replace only: extract -T imports/ro_terms_combined.txt --force true --individuals exclude --method BOT \\ to another ROBOT pipeline. Add a component A component is an import which belongs to your ontology, e.g. is managed by you and your team. Open src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml If you dont have it yet, add a new top level section components Under the components section, add a new section called products . This is where all your components are specified Under the products section, add a new component, e.g. - filename: mycomp.owl Example components: products: - filename: mycomp.owl When running sh run.sh make update_repo , a new file src/ontology/components/mycomp.owl will be created which you can edit as you see fit. Typical ways to edit: Using a ROBOT template to generate the component (see below) Manually curating the component separately with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or any other editor Providing a components/mycomp.owl: make target in src/ontology/pato.Makefile and provide a custom command to generate the component WARNING : Note that the custom rule to generate the component MUST NOT depend on any other ODK-generated file such as seed files and the like (see issue ). Providing an additional attribute for the component in src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml , source , to specify that this component should simply be downloaded from somewhere on the web. Adding a new component based on a ROBOT template Since ODK 1.3.2, it is possible to simply link a ROBOT template to a component without having to specify any of the import logic. In order to add a new component that is connected to one or more template files, follow these steps: Open src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml . Make sure that use_templates: TRUE is set in the global project options. You should also make sure that use_context: TRUE is set in case you are using prefixes in your templates that are not known to robot , such as OMOP: , CPONT: and more. All non-standard prefixes you are using should be added to config/context.json . Add another component to the products section. To activate this component to be template-driven, simply say: use_template: TRUE . This will create an empty template for you in the templates directory, which will automatically be processed when recreating the component (e.g. run.bat make recreate-mycomp ). If you want to use more than one component, use the templates field to add as many template names as you wish. ODK will look for them in the src/templates directory. Advanced: If you want to provide additional processing options, you can use the template_options field. This should be a string with option from robot template . One typical example for additional options you may want to provide is --add-prefixes config/context.json to ensure the prefix map of your context is provided to robot , see above.

If you are looking to customise imports, like changing the module type, see here . Importing a new term Note: some ontologies now use a merged-import system to manage dynamic imports, for these please follow instructions in the section title \"Using the Base Module approach\". Importing a new term is split into two sub-phases: Declaring the terms to be imported Refreshing imports dynamically Declaring terms to be imported There are three ways to declare terms that are to be imported from an external ontology. Choose the appropriate one for your particular scenario (all three can be used in parallel if need be): Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-based declaration Using term files Using the custom import template Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-based declaration This workflow is to be avoided, but may be appropriate if the editor does not have access to the ODK docker container . This approach also applies to ontologies that use base module import approach. Open your ontology (edit file) in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (5.5+). Select 'owl:Thing' Add a new class as usual. Paste the full iri in the 'Name:' field, for example, http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_50906. Click 'OK' Now you can use this term for example to construct logical definitions. The next time the imports are refreshed (see how to refresh here ), the metadata (labels, definitions, etc.) for this term are imported from the respective external source ontology and becomes visible in your ontology. Using term files Every import has, by default a term file associated with it, which can be found in the imports directory. For example, if you have a GO import in src/ontology/go_import.owl , you will also have an associated term file src/ontology/go_terms.txt . You can add terms in there simply as a list: GO:0008150 GO:0008151 Now you can run the refresh imports workflow ) and the two terms will be imported. Using the custom import template This workflow is appropriate if: You prefer to manage all your imported terms in a single file (rather than multiple files like in the \"Using term files\" workflow above). You wish to augment your imported ontologies with additional information. This requires a cautionary discussion. To enable this workflow, you add the following to your ODK config file ( src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml ), and update the repository : use_custom_import_module: TRUE Now you can manage your imported terms directly in the custom external terms template, which is located at src/templates/external_import.owl . Note that this file is a ROBOT template , and can, in principle, be extended to include any axioms you like. Before extending the template, however, read the following carefully. The main purpose of the custom import template is to enable the management off all terms to be imported in a centralised place. To enable that, you do not have to do anything other than maintaining the template. So if you, say currently import APOLLO_SV:00000480 , and you wish to import APOLLO_SV:00000532 , you simply add a row like this: ID Entity Type ID TYPE APOLLO_SV:00000480 owl:Class APOLLO_SV:00000532 owl:Class When the imports are refreshed see imports refresh workflow , the term(s) will simply be imported from the configured ontologies. Now, if you wish to extend the Makefile (which is beyond these instructions) and add, say, synonyms to the imported terms, you can do that, but you need to (a) preserve the ID and ENTITY columns and (b) ensure that the ROBOT template is valid otherwise, see here . WARNING . Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue ). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong. However, since people are doing it, whether the OBO Foundry likes it or not, at least using the custom imports module as described here localises the changes to a single simple template and ensures that none of the annotations added this way are merged into the base file . Refresh imports If you want to refresh the import yourself (this may be necessary to pass the travis tests), and you have the ODK installed, you can do the following (using go as an example): First, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then, you regenerate the import that will now include any new terms you have added. Note: You must have docker installed . sh run.sh make PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B Since ODK 1.2.27, it is also possible to simply run the following, which is the same as the above: sh run.sh make refresh-go Note that in case you changed the defaults, you need to add IMP=true and/or MIR=true to the command below: sh run.sh make IMP=true MIR=true PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B If you wish to skip refreshing the mirror, i.e. skip downloading the latest version of the source ontology for your import (e.g. go.owl for your go import) you can set MIR=false instead, which will do the exact same thing as the above, but is easier to remember: sh run.sh make IMP=true MIR=false PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B Using the Base Module approach Since ODK 1.2.31, we support an entirely new approach to generate modules: Using base files. The idea is to only import axioms from ontologies that actually belong to it . A base file is a subset of the ontology that only contains those axioms that nominally belong there. In other words, the base file does not contain any axioms that belong to another ontology.

This is solved by _first merging all mirrors into one huge file and then extracting one mega module from it. Example: Let's say we are importing terms from Uberon, GO and RO in our ontologies. When we use the base pipelines, we 1) First obtain the base (usually by simply downloading it, but there is also an option now to create it with ROBOT) 2) We merge all base files into one big pile 3) Then we extract a single module imports/merged_import.owl The first implementation of this pipeline is PATO, see https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/blob/master/src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml. To check if your ontology uses this method, check src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml to see if use_base_merging: TRUE is declared under import_group If your ontology uses Base Module approach, please use the following steps: First, add the term to be imported to the term file associated with it (see above \"Using term files\" section if this is not clear to you) Next, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then refresh imports by running sh run.sh make imports/merged_import.owl Note: if your mirrors are updated, you can run sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-merged This requires quite a bit of memory on your local machine, so if you encounter an error, it might be a lack of memory on your computer.

You wish to augment your imported ontologies with additional information. This requires a cautionary discussion. To enable this workflow, you add the following to your ODK config file ( src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml ), and update the repository : use_custom_import_module: TRUE Now you can manage your imported terms directly in the custom external terms template, which is located at src/templates/external_import.owl . Note that this file is a ROBOT template , and can, in principle, be extended to include any axioms you like. Before extending the template, however, read the following carefully. The main purpose of the custom import template is to enable the management off all terms to be imported in a centralised place. To enable that, you do not have to do anything other than maintaining the template. So if you, say currently import APOLLO_SV:00000480 , and you wish to import APOLLO_SV:00000532 , you simply add a row like this: ID Entity Type ID TYPE APOLLO_SV:00000480 owl:Class APOLLO_SV:00000532 owl:Class When the imports are refreshed see imports refresh workflow , the term(s) will simply be imported from the configured ontologies. Now, if you wish to extend the Makefile (which is beyond these instructions) and add, say, synonyms to the imported terms, you can do that, but you need to (a) preserve the ID and ENTITY columns and (b) ensure that the ROBOT template is valid otherwise, see here . WARNING . Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue ). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong. However, since people are doing it, whether the OBO Foundry likes it or not, at least using the custom imports module as described here localises the changes to a single simple template and ensures that none of the annotations added this way are merged into the base file .","title":"Using the custom import template"},{"location":"odk-workflows/UpdateImports/#refresh-imports","text":"If you want to refresh the import yourself (this may be necessary to pass the travis tests), and you have the ODK installed, you can do the following (using go as an example): First, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then, you regenerate the import that will now include any new terms you have added.
