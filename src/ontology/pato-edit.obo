comment: Example: [E=organism Q=lacks_all_parts_of_type E2=Wing] - applies to an organism. A relational quality in which the bearer entity has no parts of the specified type. The bearer of this quality has_part = 0 of the indicated entity type, where a comparable organism usually has at least 1 part of the same type. Note that the bearer of the quality is the whole, not the part. Formally: If a bearer entity e lacks all parts of type X at time t, then there exists no instances x of X at t such that x part_of e that has no wings, where wings are normally present in that organism type. In OWL this is equivalent to a restriction on the OBO_REL:has_part relation with cardinality=0, i.e has_part 0 E2.

comment: The word "torsion" has multiple different meanings in different context (e.g. the act of twisting or the morphology of the digestive tract in gastropods). This term refers purely to the resulting shape and is not to be used in the engineering and mechanics sense of torsion. \nNote: kinked PATO:0001798(synonym twisted) is similar to 'torsioned', but it is different in that something that is kinked has sharp twists or turns.

comment: This is specific to cortical bipolar cells and are distinguished from retinal bipolar cell morphology which has an axon and dendrite emerging from opposite ends of the soma.

comment: refer to https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/issues/454 for obsoletion reason. \nOBSOLETE. Example: 'Lewy bodies increased number related to dystrophic neurite increased number' (from annotation of PMID:8740227 in http://ccdb.ucsd.edu/1.0/NDPO.owl#ndpo_404). Here the increase in the number of lewy bodies is directly_associated_with the increase in the number of dystrophic neurites.\nAssociation is weaker than correlation or proportionality. These relations may be later added to PATO.

comment: Refer to https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/issues/454. There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.

comment: refer to https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/issues/454 for obsoletion reason.\nOBSOLETE. PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.
